Satellite Congestion Map 3D

This is a 3D satellite tracking app created as a personal learning project, not intended for commercial use.
Tracks satellites and debris using NORAD CAT IDs with data provided by Space-Track (https://www.space-track.org, non-commercial use only).
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and CesiumJS (https://cesium.com, used under free tier for educational purposes).
Deployed on Vercel: [Live Demo](https://satellite-congestion-map-3d.vercel.app/)

**Privacy Note**: No personal data or cookies are collected by this app.
**Usage Note**: This app is designed to be run on PC browsers mainly. Mobile support (e.g., iPhone Safari) is limited; adding satellites via search may cause excessive zoom issues.
**Known Issues**: Cesium token loading may fail occasionally (HTTP 404 error), currently under improvement.
**Planned**: Mobile optimization in the future.
